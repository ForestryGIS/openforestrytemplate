Forestry Template
====================

Database template for managing forestry data in GIS Programs. 

The Most important part is it's open and evolving and doesn't prefer one software program over another although the first few iterations will probably be strictly postgis/spatialite. 

Until I get a handle on this I'm just making notes in markdown files. pretty soon I'll start putting sql code up here (for postgres/postgis at first). 


Tables I think need to be included (and you will find a markdown file) 

*assets - physical assets like gates, fences, culverts   
*roads - roads with the type of road  
*stands - stands that will be managed
